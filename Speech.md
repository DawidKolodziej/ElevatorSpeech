## Elevator Speech
My name is Dawid and am graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, during university I focused on completing a various number of technical projects which included: An Android Mobile application in Java centred around keeping track of the user's thoughts and mental wellbeing. Also, for my dissertation I constructed A virtual reality education application in Unreal Engine 4 with the aim to teach students going through their GCSE's about 3D geometry and mathematical concepts. Before university I undertook a 2-year study to complete a level 3 extended diploma in Information technology as I have always had a passion for technology and its ever-evolving nature. Going forward with my professional career, I decided that dev ops is a perfect way for me to start within the technical industry like I have always wanted as it will enable me to learn a variety of different technical and interpersonal skills in-order to push my professional career within the right direction. Sparta global seems to share the same kind of values I find important within an organisation and that is why I believe this is the right path for me.
